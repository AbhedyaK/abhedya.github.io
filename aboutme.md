Hello World, It's Abhedya! 
I'm a Computer Engineer and a full time Data Scientist! Previously, I was a CS Grad at New York University, wherein I worked as a Research Associate at the NYU High Speed Networking Lab for detecting Cyber Intrusions using Deep Learning! I dropped out of NYU to work on my own AI startup in medical imaging(more on the coming soon ;) )!  

I'm currently researching deep learning methods and working on my startup in the medical imaging domain! More on that soon ;). 

My skillset includes the following-
  - Python, C++
  - Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Data Viz.

Previously, I've developed certain projects based on Robotics and Deep Learning!
