Hello World, It's Abhedya! 
I'm a Computer Engineer and a full time Data Scientist! Previously, I was a CS Grad at New York University, wherein I worked as a Research Associate at the NYU High Speed Networking Lab for detecting Cyber Intrusions using Deep Learning! I dropped out of NYU to work on my own startup!  

I'm currently researching deep learning methods and working on my startup in the medical imaging domain! More on that soon ;). 

My skillset includes the following-
  - Python, C++.

Oh! I also am a bike rider and a fitness enthusiast! I'm also a caffeine addict, and an avid reader!
